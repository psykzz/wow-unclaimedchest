# Mythic+ Unclaimed Chests


This is a small LibDataBroker addon that provides data on your characters unclaimed mythic+ chests.

This addon will track every character, above level 120.
On each of those characters, it will show the state of the chest as either:

* incomplete - You still need to complete a mythic this week
* complete - You have completeted a key, but waiting for reset
* claimable - You have a claimable mythic+ chest on this character.


## FAQ

The addon is still new, so little testing has been done.
If you do have any issues though, you can leave an issue on [github](https://github.com/psykzz/wow-unclaimedchest/issues/new), or ping me on discord (psykzz#4695).
